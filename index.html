            Sir Agriye The Great-Biography(Chemistry)
            He is known for inventing indicator of Hibiscus and Rose.
            Although they are bad indicators of acids and bases and nobody in the world know that they are good indicators and nobody invented such indicator.
            The story how he invented is as followed:-
            An incidence happened that he was not having china rose as indicator, he brought rose and hibiscus water as indicator that any would work, But none of them worked.
            So he mixed them. Now he tested again, and he was shocked that it worked as an indicator. So this invention was invented by nobody in the world did this.
